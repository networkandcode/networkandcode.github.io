Let's run the juice shop as a docker container on our local system, you should have already 
installed docker to perform this exercise.

Check if docker is installed, I have the following version.
```
$ docker -v
Docker version 19.03.13, build cd8016b6bc
```

Pull the juice shop docker image from docker hub.
```
$ docker pull bkimminich/juice-shop

Status: Downloaded newer image for bkimminich/juice-shop:latest
docker.io/bkimminich/juice-shop:latest
```

We can now see this image in our local registry.
```
$ docker image ls bkimminich/juice-shop
REPOSITORY              TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
bkimminich/juice-shop   latest              3ed777581dce        5 weeks ago         488MB
```

Let's run it, on the localhost port 8000, which maps to the container port 3000.
```
$ docker run -d -p 8000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop
23d947b010d8fe6667bff18bcc67124fbb25e9c70f90a95af49d405939bcf415
```

The container should be running in the background.
```
$ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
23d947b010d8        bkimminich/juice-shop   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   46 seconds ago      Up 44 seconds       0.0.0.0:8000->3000/tcp   nice_khorana
```

Its running and hence we should be able to access it's UI in the browser on port 8000.

The container can be stopped, when required by mentioning the container id with the stop command.
```
$ docker container stop 23d947b010d8
23d947b010d8
```

The container doesn't exist any more.
```
$ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
$ 
```
