#title: kubernetes > build a private docker registry
#categories: kubernetes
---

Let's see how we can build our own private docker registry as a kubernetes workload. You need 
familiarity with docker, openssl, kubernets deployments, services to follow along.

On my system, where I have kubectl installed, I am going to first prepare the cert.

Create a directory to keep the certificates, and switch to that directory.
```
networkandcode@ubuntu20:~$ mkdir docker-registry && cd $_
networkandcode@ubuntu20:~/docker-registry$ 
```

Using openssl, let's generate a private key and public certificate.
```
networkandcode@ubuntu20:~/docker-registry$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 \ 
-nodes -sha256 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj "/CN=docker-registry"
Generating a RSA private key
.....................++++
........................................................................................................................++++
writing new private key to 'tls.key'
-----

$ ls -l
total 8
-rw-rw-r-- 1 networkandcode networkandcode 1822 Aug 14 12:00 tls.crt
-rw------- 1 networkandcode networkandcode 3276 Aug 14 12:00 tls.key

```

For understanding, let's see why we used the options above.
```
$ openssl req -help
```

The above command should provide the summary, using which we can find the following.
```
-x509               Output a x509 structure instead of a cert request
                     (Required by some CA's)
-newkey val         Specify as type:bits
-days +int          Number of days cert is valid for
-nodes              Don't encrypt the output key
-*                  Any supported digest
-keyout outfile     File to send the key to
-out outfile        Output file
-subject            Output the request's subject
```

So, we have used openssl to generate a x509 cerificate, for a new key of type RSA and modulus 4096 bits.
The validiy of the certificate we generate will be valid for 365 days. We are using SHA256 as the hash 
function or message digest algorithm. The key will be saved in the file tls.key. The certificate will 
be saved in the file tls.crt. The certificate request will have the common name docker-registry in the 
subject.

Let's use the generated key and certificate in a kubernetes secret object specially meant for tls.
```
$ kubectl create secret tls docker-registry-tls --key=tls.key --cert=tls.crt
secret/docker-registry created
```

The name of the secret we created is docker-registry, and the secret's type is TLS.
```
$ kubectl get secret docker-registry-tls
NAME                  TYPE                DATA   AGE
docker-registry-tls   kubernetes.io/tls   2      67s
```

We can save this in a file, which should help reusing it when required.
```
$ kubectl get secret docker-registry-tls -o yaml > docker-registry-tls-secret.yaml
```

Let's say we want to access the docker registry using username 'docker' and password 'p@ssword', we 
can generate a bcrypt encrypted credential with htpasswd as follows.
```
$ htpasswd -Bbn docker p@ssword
docker:$2y$05$enG4ZbF26pDVZQ391loSju4qOXc5bPZT81kYqdAGDbdi4o1A4EU5q
```

The options we used are:
```
-B  Force bcrypt encryption of the password (very secure).
-b  Use the password from the command line rather than prompting for it.
-n  Don't update file; display results on stdout.
```

Let's define our secret manifest with this data.
```
$ cat secret-docker-registry-htpasswd.yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: docker-registry-htpasswd
stringData:
  htpasswd: docker:$2y$05$enG4ZbF26pDVZQ391loSju4qOXc5bPZT81kYqdAGDbdi4o1A4EU5q
...
```

And then create it. Note that this is a generic(Opaque) secret, where as the first one we created was 
of type TLS.
```
$ kubectl create -f secret-docker-registry-htpasswd.yaml
secret/docker-registry-htpasswd created
```

So, we now have two secrets, one for TLS key and certificate, and the other for the credential.
```
$ kubectl get secret | grep docker
docker-registry-htpasswd     Opaque                                1      107s
docker-registry-tls          kubernetes.io/tls                     2      19m
```

Let's define the config map which contains the overall configuration for our registry.
```
$ cat docker-registry-cm.yaml 
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: docker-registry
data: 
  config.yml: |
    version: 0.1
    log:
      fields:
        service: registry
    storage:
      cache:
        blobdescriptor: inmemory
      filesystem:
        rootdirectory: /var/lib/registry
    http:
      addr: 0.0.0.0:443
      headers:
        X-Content-Type-Options: [nosniff]
      tls:
        cert: /etc/ssl/registry/tls.crt
        key: /etc/ssl/registry/tls.key       
    auth:
      htpasswd:
        realm: "Registry Realm"
        path: /etc/docker/authentication
    health:
      storagedriver:
        enabled: true
        interval: 10s
        threshold: 3
...
```

Create the config map.
```
$ kubectl create -f docker-registry-cm.yaml 
configmap/docker-registry created
```

Ok so we have the created the data objects, 2 secrets and one config map. We would also need to setup 
a volume so that the registry is persistent and we do not loose data on pod restarts. For this 
exercise we would leverage the hostPath volume, so that the data is saved on the kubernetes node itself.

Let's define the deployment.
```
$ cat docker-registry-deploy.yaml 
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: docker-registry
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      function: registry
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        function: registry
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: docker-registry
        # image will be picked from docker hub
        image: registry:2.7.1
        volumeMounts:
          - name: config
            mountPath: /etc/docker/registry
            readOnly: true
          - name: credential
            mountPath: /etc/docker/authentication
            readOnly: true
          - name: registry
            mountPath: /var/lib/registry
          - name: tls
            mountPath: /etc/ssl/registry
            readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: config
        configMap:
          name: docker-registry
      - name: credential
        secret:
          secretName: docker-registry-htpasswd
      - name: registry
        hostPath:
          path: /var/lib/docker-registry
      - name: tls
        secret:
          secretName: docker-registry-tls
```

Create the deployment.
```
$ kubectl create -f docker-registry-deploy.yaml 
deployment.apps/docker-registry created
```

Let's check the status of the deployment, replica set, and the pod
```
$ kubectl get all | grep docker-registry
pod/docker-registry-bf9b44585-8897c   1/1     Running   0          3m21s
deployment.apps/docker-registry   1/1     1            1           3m21s
replicaset.apps/docker-registry-bf9b44585   1         1         1       3m21s
```

We can check if the config and secrets are injected to the container.
```
docker-registry-7c8cd4c47-lpqrt
$ kubectl exec -it docker-registry-86896c68c5-vg95k -- /bin/sh

/ # cat /etc/docker/authentication/htpasswd
docker:$2y$05$enG4ZbF26pDVZQ391loSju4qOXc5bPZT81kYqdAGDbdi4o1A4EU5q

/ # ls /etc/docker/registry
config.yml

/ # ls /etc/ssl/registry
tls.crt  tls.key

```

Let's expose the docker registry as a service. Note that the container port is 5000.
```
$ cat docker-registry-svc.yaml 
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: docker-registry
spec:
  selector:
    function: registry
  ports:
  - name: registry
    port: 443
    targetPort: 443
...
```

Let's create the service, and validate the endpoints.
```
$ kubectl create -f docker-registry-svc.yaml 
service/docker-registry created

$ kubectl get svc docker-registry
NAME              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
docker-registry   ClusterIP   10.43.135.120   <none>        8000/TCP   64s

$ kubectl get ep docker-registry
NAME              ENDPOINTS        AGE
docker-registry   10.42.2.3:5000   78s

$ kubectl get po -o wide | grep docker-registry
docker-registry-7c8cd4c47-lpqrt   1/1     Running   0          5m40s   10.42.2.3   node1   <none>           <none>
```

So the IP 10.42.2.3 is matching. Please make a note of the service ip and port which is 
10.43.135.120:8000, this is where the docker registry is available in the cluster.

Since the nodes need to communicate with the docker registry, we can add a dns entry in the hosts file 
on all nodes.
```
$ ssh root@<public ip of master> "echo '10.43.135.120 docker-registry' >> /etc/hosts"
$ ssh root@<public ip of node1> "echo '10.43.135.120 docker-registry' >> /etc/hosts"
$ ssh root@<public ip of node2> "echo '10.43.135.120 docker-registry' >> /etc/hosts"
```

This means the registry can be access with a name from the nodes, i.e. docker-registry:5000.

Next step is to copy the public certificate we generated earlier for the docker-registry as ca.crt in 
the nodes, in a specific path /etc/docker/certs.d/registry-name:port, if we replace this with our 
registry name and port, it would become /etc/docker/certs.d/docker-registry:8000.

In our nodes, we first need to create the directorirs certs.d and docker-registry:5000. We can do this 
with a single command.
```
$ ssh root@<public ip of master> "mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/docker-registry:8000"
$ ssh root@<public ip of node1> "mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/docker-registry:8000"
$ ssh root@<public ip of node2> "mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/docker-registry:8000"
```

We can now copy the certificate.
```
$ scp tls.crt root@<public ip of master>:/etc/docker/certs.d/docker-registry:8000/ca.crt
tls.crt                                                              100% 1822     4.3KB/s   00:00    

$ scp tls.crt root@<public ip of node1>:/etc/docker/certs.d/docker-registry:8000/ca.crt
tls.crt                                                              100% 1822    17.3KB/s   00:00    

$ scp tls.crt root@<public ip of node2>:/etc/docker/certs.d/docker-registry:8000/ca.crt
tls.crt                                 
```

We have setup the nodes, to interact with our private docker registry. Let's login to one of the nodes 
and see if we can authenticate to the docker registry.
```
$ ssh root@<public ip of master>

root@localhost:~# docker login

```
